Approximately 30 days before you check in to the hotel, we will take a deposit of your first night’s stay plus tax from the card you have put on file. 
If making a reservation within 30 days of check in, a deposit will be taken at the time you make your reservation. 7 days prior to arrival we will charge 
your card for the remaining balance. Both charges are refundable if you cancel before your hotel’s individual cancellation timeframe. This timeframe is 
typically between 48-72 hours prior to arrival but is specific to the hotel you booked. You can see your hotel’s cancellation policy on the hotel listing 
page under the tournament you signed up for. Prior to hotel check in you will receive an email with your reservation information and your hotel confirmation 
number. At check in, you will be asked to provide a credit card to keep on file for incidentals such as parking fees or breakfast if your hotel does not provide 
those amenities complimentary.
